## Documentation for Badge Verity

Badge Verity is a utility that performs several tasks related to validating badges, particularly:
* Testing whether a badgeClass is a valid instance of an OBI badgeClass, obeying the OBI standard, as defined in JSON-schema
* Testing the properties of badgeClass instances to ensure they are well-formed against JSON-schemas specific to their type.
* Allows the addition of additional rules for extension properties in the form of schemas in a datastore or file.
